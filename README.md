#### BIO

Drawing from extensive experience in the financial sector, I have embarked on a new adventure as an application developer for Apple environments. I am passionate about learning and growing in the world of technology, and I have been dedicating my efforts to mastering the Swift language for the past two years. I have knowledge of SwiftUI, Core Data, Firebase, and REST API networking. 

In the world of development, I have collaborated with small mobile game development studios, in this case, creating the soundtrack for the games. Besides programming, composing music is my other great passion.

 ⛏️ I'm working right now in my first iOS apps </br></br>
